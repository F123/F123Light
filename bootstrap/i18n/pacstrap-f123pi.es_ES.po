# Fernando:
#
# The hardest string in this template will be the usage message.
# Try to keep it to a similar format. Option lines and their 
explanations are indented by one tab.
# Other lines are not indented.
#
# Shorter strings like "Invalid option should be easy.
#
# There will be a lot more than this but this is a small one to get 
started with.
#
# Where you see a variable that starts with a dollar sign, it's very 
important not to change the name of it or the format.
#
# The values in the 'msgid' strings should not be changed since it is 
these which the scripts use
# to look up the translations.
#
# Don't be confused by the empty string "" in some msgid entries where 
there multiple lines such as in the usage message.
